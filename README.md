# GoPoker  

Server side poker backend implementation in pure Golang. Communication is done through Protobuf or JSON via [jsonpb](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/protobuf/jsonpb).

### Getting started
Given that there are 2 decoupled sections to this poker backend running a server requires one to create a startup file similar to the one located in [configs/example.yaml](../blob/master/configs/example.yaml).

### Documentation
